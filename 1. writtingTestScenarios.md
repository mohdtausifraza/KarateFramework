### Create a file getRequest.feature with the below Gherkin and Karate Keyword
- writtingTestScenarios

### Create a Runner 
- 


### Using Path Variable
- Whenever we are testing an application which is having more than one end point, we can use path variable.
- Every URL is having two parts [basePart + ContextPart]
    - BasePart : [http://localhost:9897]
    - ContextPart : [normal/webapi/all]

### Using Background keyword
- The statement which is moved inside background keyword will be executed for all the scenarios
- Once the URL is defined in the Background Keyword
  - **Background: Setup the base path** 
  - Given url 'http://localhost:9897'
- Now you can give the context path in two ways
  - Using **Given** Keyword
    - Given path '/normal/webapi/all'
  - Using **And** Keyword
    - And path '/normal/webapi/all'

### Print Keyword
- This keyword is provided by karate Framework
- It is similar to using **System.out.println()**
  - And 

### Using Headers Keyword
- In Karate Framework we can use Header Keyword to specify the headers which we want's to send along with our request, same as we do in the postman
  - And header Accept = 'application/xml'
- Now you will get the response in xml format.


### Response Variable
- When you use this, the response of the request get stored in a variable called **Response**.
- Which you can use this Response variable to add some additional **assertion** or validation in the test script.
- **Example : responseMatcher.feature**
  - And print response
  - Here response is the response variable provided by the Karate, which will store the response of the request.

## Assertions | Matchers | Fuzzy Matchers
- Use match keyword to match the response 
- And match response == """ **Paste the response to be match in Json/xml format**
